[This Jupyter notebook](demo_L0Hawkes.ipynb) provides full details (tested on 06/10/2024 on a clean pip environment with libraries described in `requirements.txt`). Enjoy!


## Dependency

The core module `L0HawkesLib.py` depends **only on `numpy`**. This is the only critical dependency of this Python implementation of the *L0Hawkes* algorithm.

For visualization purposes, a utility library called `L0HawkesVisualize.py` has been included, which depends on:
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

If you want to reproduce the notebook as it is, I suggest running
```python
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn
```
on a clean pip environment so all the sub-libraries will be automatically installed.

If you are not comfortable with installing these, just download only `L0HawkesLib.py` and use it in your environment.
